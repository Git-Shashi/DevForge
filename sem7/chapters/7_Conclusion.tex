\chapter{Conclusion}

DevForge demonstrates a practical blueprint for a self-hostable, browser-based IDE with persistent, per-project containers. By combining Next.js, MongoDB, Redis, and Docker through a typed, modular codebase, it delivers a streamlined developer workflow that reduces setup friction and improves reproducibility. The platform validates the feasibility of providing a familiar editing experience (via Monaco) alongside real-time terminal access and safe, isolated environments.

Future extensions—collaborative editing, prebuilds, and optional Kubernetes—can broaden its applicability to larger teams and more demanding workloads, while preserving the project’s emphasis on clarity and control.
